    THIS IS JUST FILE FOR REFRENCE:
    
     THIRD PARTY LIBRARIES:
 
 

       I did not use any third part libary . I could have used Alamofire for networking and sdWebImage for image loading.
       Instead i used URLSession for networking and loaded images using inbuilt swift functionalitis
       I try to always mininise the use of third party libaries as much as i can since relying on third parties can some time bring problems
        
 
        My API link has no video or the movie link homepage so did not do that . I used every variable found in the API
 
 
        Please run with physical iphone 11 or Iphone 11 simulator . I did layout with iphone 11
 
 
        I used MVC . This is a simple app so both design work without major problems . I always prefer using MVVM instead of MVC all the time because of the ViewModel relieving a lot of stress from the ViewControllers and also easy testing of ViewModel functionalities compared to functionailties in the ViewControllers
 

 
        I used extenstions almost everywhere to separate code logic with Marks.
