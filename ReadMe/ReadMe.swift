    Dear Felipe and  Caio.
 
        Below is a short describtion of the reason why i used what patterns/designs etc that i used.
    
          1: THIRD PARTY LIBRARIES:
               I did not use any third part libary . I could have used Alamofire for networking and sdWebImage for image loading.
               Instead i used URLSession for networking and loaded images using inbuilt swift functionalitis
                I try to always mininise the use of third party libaries as much as i can since relying on third parties can some time bring problems
        
        2:
                My API link has no video or the movie link homepage so did not do that . I used every variable found in the API
 
        3:
                Please run with physical iphone 11 or Iphone 11 simulator . I did layout with iphone 11
 
        4:
   
                I used MVC . This is a simple app so both design work without major problems . Please note that I always prefer using MVVM instead of MVC all the time because of the ViewModel relieving a lot of stress from the ViewControllers and also easy testing of ViewModel functionalities compared to functionailties in the ViewControllers.
        5:
 
               I used extenstions almost everywhere to separate code logic with Marks.
